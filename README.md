‚úÖ Improve guest experience
‚úÖ Reduce cancellations

Core areas of analysis:

Booking Performance: Analyzing occupancy rates, booking volumes, and seasonality.

Revenue Streams: Evaluating revenue from room bookings and ancillary services.

Cancellation Rates: Identifying patterns and drivers behind booking cancellations.

## 2. üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Database: Microsoft SQL Server

- Data Analysis & Querying: SQL

- Data Visualization & Dashboarding: Microsoft Power BI

## 3. üóÇÔ∏è Data Processing & Analysis (SQL)
### 3.1 Database Setup
- Database: hotel_analysis

- Main Tables:

bookings_senior

customers_senior

rooms_senior

services_senior

payments_senior

service_usage_senior

### 3.2 Data Integrity
Establishing foreign key constraints to ensure relational integrity:

-- Adding foreign key from bookings_senior to customers_senior
ALTER TABLE bookings_senior
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_customer
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
    REFERENCES customers_senior(customer_id);

-- Adding foreign key from bookings_senior to rooms_senior
ALTER TABLE bookings_senior
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_room
    FOREIGN KEY (room_id)
    REFERENCES rooms_senior(room_id);
